Expr
====

A simple command line utility to parse mathematical expressions.

Simple Usage
------------

To evaluate an expression, simply pass it as arguments:

```bash
  expr <expression> [<expression>...]
```

For example, the invloking `expr 1+1` will output `2`. Arguments are concatenated when evaluating the expression, thus ignoring spaces in between arguments.
As a result, one could also write `expr 1 + 1`.
